## Introduction
This repository implements the proposed classical projected gradient ascent (PGA) algorithm and the unfolded PGA.

## Python Code
### Description
The code includes one file named 'main.py' in which the DNN model is being defined and the training procedure is being executed as well.

### Execution
To execute the code you can use any Python IDE, we used PyCharm.

You need to install the following Python libraries:
* NumPy
* PyTorch
* Matplotlib
